= Transition of Other Elements =

== Actor/Entity Transition ==


When transitioning '''Actors''' or '''Entities''' (and other Capella core elements), the references of cybersecurity extension elements are also transitioned. Actors can have Trust Boundary Storage references as well as attributes such as threat level which can be seen are transitioned as in the example below:

If the Actor is a '''Threat Source''' and is '''using''' another '''Actor''' to threat the system, the use relation and the references are also transitioned:

To be noted that due to the Threat Involvement extension a Threat that "Involves" a Component (Entity/Actor) will also transition that Component.

== Function Transition ==


Just like above, when transitioning '''Functions''' (or Operational Activities) the references of cybersecurity extension elements are also transitioned. Functions can have Function Storage and Security Needs references which can be seen are transitioned as in the example below:

== Scenario/Functional Transition ==

As a ''Threat'' is similar to a Operational Capability/Capability/Capability Realization in Capella, the user can do '''Scenario/Functional''' transitions.
