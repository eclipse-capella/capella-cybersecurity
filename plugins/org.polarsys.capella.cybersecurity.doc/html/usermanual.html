		<p>The intent of this viewpoint is to support effective co-engineering between systems and
			cybersecurity engineering teams when performing the following tasks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify assets &amp; trust boundaries</li>
			<li>Identify threats</li>
			<li>Characterize security needs</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Cybersecurity_Projects">Cybersecurity Projects</h3>
		<p>To create a project with the Cybersecurity viewpoint activated automatically, select

			<i>File-&gt;New-&gt;Cybersecurity Project</i> from the application menu.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Concepts">Concepts</h2>
		<p>Cybersecurity Specific Properties of Model Elements can be seen in the 
			<i>Cybersecurity</i> tab of the Properties View. This section lists the most important concepts and their properties.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Actor">Actor</h3>
		<p>An 
			<i>Actor</i> is involved in 
			<i>Threats</i> and allocates one or more 
			<i>Functions</i>.
		</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Threat Source 	</td>
				<td>Someone or something that could affect the product (ref: 87210649-DDQ-GRP-EN - Cyber Security For Architects Guide).</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Threat Source Profile</td>
				<td>Type of threat source.</td>
				<td>1 to 5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Trusted</td>
				<td>Ability to be relied on as honest or truthful. Threat Source = Yes =&gt; Trusted = false.</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Rationale</td>
				<td>Rationale on the cybersecurity attributes. The trustworthiness of an Actor is absolute, it does not depend on the Threat that the Actor is involved in, or a given security property. Details on this aspect and others can be exposed in this Rationale field.</td>
				<td>Text </td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2 id="Threat">Threat</h2>
		<p>A situation that is unwanted by the stakeholders and that is to be avoided. Threat is an abstract concept that is concretized by the following kinds of attacks:</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Eavesdropping</td>
				<td>Secretly listening to the private conversation of others without their consent.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Theft and data alteration</td>
				<td>Stealing, leaking data, modifying data, erasing data, attack against traceability or against rogue action detection.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Denial of Service</td>
				<td>DoS attacks make a machine, a service or a network resource unavailable to its intended users.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Intrusion </td>
				<td>Entering an information system without permission.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Tampering</td>
				<td>Tampering attacks refer to many forms of sabotage (intentional modification of the information system in a way that makes them harmful).</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			<i>Threats</i> are applied to 
			<i>Primary Assets</i>.
			A Threat has the following additional attributes:
		</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Level</td>
				<td>Priority level given to a Threat at a given stage of design process. It can be motivated by cybersecurity risk analysis; e.g. may be an indication of the likelihood of threat scenarios and the impact of the feared event associated to the threat.</td>
				<td>1 to 5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Rationale</td>
				<td>Rationale on the cybersecurity attributes.</td>
				<td>Text</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2 id="Primary_Asset">Primary Asset</h2>
		<p>Information, activity, process or functionality that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected (ref: 87210649-DDQ-GRP-EN - Cyber Security For Architects Guide). The Cybersecurity Viewpoint
			distinguishes between:</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Functional Primary Asset</td>
				<td>Activity, process or functionality that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected.</td>
				<td>Functions</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Information Primary Asset</td>
				<td>Information that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected.</td>
				<td>Exchange Items</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The attributes of a Primary Asset are its corresponding Security Needs, i.e. the characteristics that can be compromised / affected by a threat (based on ref: 87210649-DDQ-GRP-EN - Cyber Security For Architects Guide) and their sensitivity levels. The following characteristics are considered here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Confidentiality: property that information is only available to authorized persons.</li>
			<li>Integrity: property of accuracy and completeness (WRT authorized entities).</li>
			<li>Availability: property of being accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity.</li>
			<li>Traceability: property of verifying access and use thanks to documented recorded identification.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An asset can define a value between 0 and 3 for each of these attributes. Project/Product teams shall define the equivalences between these sensitivity levels and those specific to their standards framework.</p>
		<p>Primary Assets are threatened by Threats.</p>
		<h2 id="Function">Function</h2>
		<p>Action, operation or service performed by the system, or by an actor interacting with the system (ref: Arcadia).
			Like Primary Assets, Functions can define values for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Traceability.</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Data Storage</td>
				<td>Indicates that the function represents a data storage functionality.</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Remanent Data</td>
				<td>Indicates that the function manipulates data in such a way that data (or parts of it) remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase it.</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2 id="Exchange_Item">Exchange Item</h2>
		<p>A Exchange Item describes a set of Data semantically coherent with regards to their usage in a given context: same communication principles, simultaneity of transportation, same non functional properties, indivisibility (an Exchange Item is monolithic). (ref. Arcadia)
			An Information Primary Asset references one or more Exchange Items. An Exchange Item can define values for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Traceability.</p>
