		<h1 id="DARC_Viewpoint">DARC Viewpoint</h1>
		<p>DARC Viewpoint is installed as viewpoint on Capella to manage Cybersecurity and Threats Modeling in relation with Arcadia methodology.</p>
		<p>The intent of this viewpoint is to support effective co-engineering between systems and
			cybersecurity engineering teams when performing the following tasks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify assets &amp; trust boundaries</li>
			<li>Identify threats</li>
			<li>Characterize security needs</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Concepts">Concepts</h2>
		<p>Cybersecurity Specific Properties of Model Elements can be seen in the 
			<i>Cybersecurity</i> tab of the Properties View. This section lists the most important concepts and their properties.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Actor">Actor</h2>
		<p>An 
			<i>Actor</i> is involved in 
			<i>Threats</i> and allocates one or more 
			<i>Functions</i>.

		<p>If an Actor is

			The user shall be able to identify how a Threat Source can use another Actor/Entity of the system to attack the system. This can be done trough the 
			<b>'use</b>' relation, available in the Threat Diagrams or from the properties view of a Threat Source. This 
			<i>use</i> relation shall be validated by the existence of functional exchanges, component exchanges or physical exchanges between them.

		<h2 id="Threat">Threat</h2>
		<p>A situation that is unwanted by the stakeholders and that is to be avoided. Threat is an abstract concept that is concretized by the following kinds of attacks (by default):</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Eavesdropping</td>
				<td>Secretly listening to the private conversation of others without their consent.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Intrusion </td>

			<tr>
				<td>Tampering</td>
				<td>Tampering attacks refer to many forms of sabotage (intentional modification of the information system in a way that makes them harmful).</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			<i>Threat kinds</i> can be customized by the user in the Cybersecurity Configuration, by editing the Threat.Kind type.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="Images/threat_kind.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The threat kinds can be updated as below: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>To add a new kind: right click on the 'Threat.Kind' -&gt; Add Capella Element -&gt; Enumeration Property Literal</li>
			<li>To edit an existing kind: double click -&gt; edit it from the open window or click -&gt; edit from properties view</li>
			<li>To remove a kind: click on the delete button or right click -&gt; delete</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Threats</b> are applied to 
			<i>Primary Assets</i> and are similar to the 
			<b>Capabilities</b> from Capella. Under a 
			<i>Threat</i>, the user can do the same operations as to an Operational Capability/Capability/Capability Realization:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="Images/threat-abstract-capability.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A Threat has the following additional attributes:</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Level</td>
				<td>Priority level given to a Threat at a given stage of design process. It can be motivated by cybersecurity risk analysis; e.g. may be an indication of the likelihood of threat scenarios and the impact of the feared event associated to the threat.</td>
				<td>1 to 5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Rationale</td>
				<td>Rationale on the cybersecurity attributes.</td>
				<td>Text</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Additionally, like Primary Assets, Threats can also define and customize Security Needs (see next section).</p>
		<h2 id="Primary_Asset">Primary Asset</h2>
		<p>Information, activity, process or functionality that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected. Primary Assets are threatened by Threats.

			<br/>
			The DARC Viewpoint distinguishes between:
		</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Functional Primary Asset</td>
				<td>Activity, process or functionality that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected.</td>
				<td>Functions and Functional Chains</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Information Primary Asset</td>
				<td>Information that is valuable for the customer and then needs to be protected.</td>
				<td>Exchange Items</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Enterprise Primary Asset</td>
				<td>Enterprise Primary Assets are realized through sets of Functional and/or Information Primary Assets.</td>
				<td>Functional/Information Primary Assets</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			<img height="357" width="968" border="0" src="Images/Properties_EnterprisePrimaryAssets.png"/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="CIAT_Security_Needs_customization">CIAT Security Needs customization</h3>
		<p>The attributes of a Primary Asset are its corresponding Security Needs, i.e. the characteristics that can be compromised / affected by a threat and their sensitivity levels. The following characteristics are considered here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Confidentiality</b>: property that information is only available to authorized persons.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Integrity</b>: property of accuracy and completeness (WRT authorized entities).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Availability</b>: property of being accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Traceability</b>: property of verifying access and use thanks to documented recorded identification.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>By default, an asset can define a value between 0 and 3 for each of these attributes. Project/Product teams shall define the equivalences between these sensitivity levels and those specific to their standards framework.
			If this values are not suitable for the project, the user could customize (remove, add, rename) them from Cybersecurity Configuration located on the root Project element (see Capella Guide &gt; Preferences &gt; Project Explorer to reveal it).</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="Images/custom_value.png"/> 
		</p>
		<h2 id="Function">Function</h2>
		<p>Action, operation or service performed by the system, or by an actor interacting with the system (ref: Arcadia).
			Like Primary Assets and Threats, Functions can define values for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Traceability.</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Data Storage</td>
				<td>Indicates that the function represents a data storage functionality.</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Remanent Data</td>
				<td>Indicates that the function manipulates data in such a way that data (or parts of it) remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase it.</td>
				<td>Yes/No</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2 id="Exchange_Item">Exchange Item</h2>
		<p>A Exchange Item describes a set of Data semantically coherent with regards to their usage in a given context: same communication principles, simultaneity of transportation, same non functional properties, indivisibility (an Exchange Item is monolithic). (ref. Arcadia)
			An Information Primary Asset references one or more Exchange Items. An Exchange Item can define values for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Traceability.</p>
		<h2 id="Diagrams">Diagrams</h2>
		<p>The following diagram types are provided by the DARC Viewpoint:</p>
